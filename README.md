# Constitution of the Imam Mahdi Youth

The Imam Mahdi Youth Group (IMY) is a collective of various young people of the Imam Mahdi Islamic Centre in Markham Ontario.
This group numbers around 30-50 active members at any time, and has had a rich history of events.
The group provides programming to build a community to foster a deeper connection to God and Islam.
This simple collective of members strives to foster a sense of **belonging**, and **ownership** to the Mosque and Islam.
It practices virtues that all Muslims and humans shall practice especially in the context of a community.
