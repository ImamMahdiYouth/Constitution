Voting to accept this as the founding document for the principles of IMY:

16 people present

Yes: 15 people

No: 0

# Membership to IMY
Debate about options for membership:

* New people who show up will be deterred by the membership cards
* We can agree to have some sort of membership. 
* Separate times for Transparency Meetings--but no one will show up. 
* Events targeting younger people are very much needed
## Financial Membership
* Yearly paid
* $5 is a good idea

## Attendance Membership
* Membership on some sort of attendance. 

## Finance
* Not a problem that we have limited funds
* Sell merch for money can be very inexpensive


# Constitution
* No Voting will take place in this meeting
* We will deliberate more on how to write this constitution.
* The right constitution enables more funding.

You have to make the IMY as something you pitch, otherwise you lose interest. 
Ruminating over details is against the spirit of the constitution. 

# Ski Trip

* Ran a deficit from the ski trip
* Carpooling is more efficient than paying for a bus

# Skating Trip
* No votes to have skating trip on Friday
* Skate trip happens on Sunday.
* You meet at Finch or just show up there. 
* Google says Ramadhan does not starts on Sunday

# Ramadhan Plans

* Hosting other youth groups for Iftar on Sundays
* More involvement with the mosque in general.
We need to be the ones who are serving food.
We will be committing one day of the week to be responsible for the running the main event of the mosque.
* Meal service at our mosque.
* Has had some push back in implementation details.
* Lectures five days in a row, English lecture in main hall, and QandA upstairs. 

# Meeting with the President

* You are the silent group who is not present. 
* I promise that if you stay within the framework of the mosque, we will be in support of you. 
* Inshallah, we will have lectures, give you more control, involvement, and ownership. 
* If the older members see your presence, we can make more demands and requests. 
* All it takes is your involvement in the mosque, to secure more funds.
