# Membership to IMY
Yearly paid

Not a problem when we are broke; keep that in mind. 

Sell merch for money can be very inexpensive. 

Membership on some sort of attendance. 

Membership cards

New people who show up will be deterred by the membership cards. 

We can agree to have some sort of membership. 

Separate times for Transparency Meetings--but no one will show up. 

Events targeting younger people. 

# Constitution
No Voting.
We will deliberate more on how to write this constitution.
The right constitution means we can get more funding.

You have to make the IMY as something you pitch, you lose interest. 
Ruminating over details is against the spirit of the constitution. 

# Ski Trip

Ran a deficit from the ski trip. 

Carpooling is more efficient. 

# Ramadhan Plans

Hosting other youth groups for Iftar on Sundays

More involvement with the mosque in general.
We need to be the ones who are serving food. 

Meal service at our mosque.
Has had some push back in implementation details.

Lectures five days in a row, English lecture in main hall, and QandA upstairs. 

# Meeting with the President

You are the silent group ho is not present. 
I promise that if you stay within the framework of the mosque, we will be in support of you. 
Inshallah, we will have lectures, give you more control, involvement, and ownership. 
If the older members see your presence, we can make more demands and requests. 
All it takes is your involvement, especially towards more funds.
