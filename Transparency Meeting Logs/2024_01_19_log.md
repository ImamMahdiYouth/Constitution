# Log of Transparency Meeting 19.01.2024

## Summary
The draft of the constitution and the responsible members were introduced. 
Visions and future plans of the responsible members were also discussed. 

## Notes on Discussion
Barrier of entry too high to make changes to constitution. 
Every transparency proposal for changes to constitution. 
Sit for six weeks and vote on it in the next six weeks.

Elaboration of values in introduction.

Consistent programming and events. 
Suggestion of minimum number of events in a certain time. 
Debate against this idea.
Consistency of programming is important and one of IMY’s goals. 
Rigidity is too early therefore, not necessary to encode these into the constitution.
Having event templates that cycle topics are valuable and key to achieving these plans. 
One event type: “elevator pitch” in this context explaining concepts about Islam like explaining a boss why you pray. 

## Voting
Voting should happen later when everyone has had the chance to review the constitution. 
Voting will tentatively happen at the next transparency meeting.
